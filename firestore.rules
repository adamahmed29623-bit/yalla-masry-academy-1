    /**
     * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All data is considered private and
     * is accessible only by the user who created it. There is no concept of public or shared data.
     *
     * Data Structure: Data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path. Each user's document
     * serves as the root for their private data, such as their `firebaseProjects` subcollection. This structure
     * ensures that all data is neatly partitioned by user.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - User Isolation: A user can only ever access documents within their own data tree (i.e., under `/users/{their_own_uid}`).
     * - No User Listing: It is forbidden to query the top-level `/users` collection to prevent exposing the list of all users.
     * - No Profile Deletion: Users cannot delete their own profile document from the client to prevent accidental data loss.
     * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents must contain an internal ID field that matches the user ID in the path,
     *   enforcing a consistent ownership link that cannot be changed on update.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization: The `FirebaseProject` documents contain a `userId` field. This allows for simple,
     * fast, and secure validation rules on create and update operations, ensuring that a project document is always correctly
     * associated with its owner without needing extra reads.
     *
     * Structural Segregation: The use of a user-specific subcollection (`/users/{userId}/firebaseProjects`) for private
     * project data is a core part of the security model. This is inherently more secure and performant for list operations
     * than mixing all projects in a single top-level collection.
